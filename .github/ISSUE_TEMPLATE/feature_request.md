## Feature Description

A clear description of what you'd like to see added.

## Use Case

Why is this feature useful? What workflow does it improve?

**Example scenarios:**
- "I want a Doom sound pack so my commits sound like a BFG firing"
- "I need a HUD metric showing disk usage because my builds fill /tmp"
- "I want flag colors for Brazil so my status bar looks right"

## Proposed Implementation

If you have ideas on how this could work:

- For **sound packs**: Which game? Which events map to which sounds?
- For **themes**: What color scheme? Any tmux template changes needed?
- For **HUD metrics**: What data source? How would it be cached?
- For **flag colors**: Which country? What are the colour256 values?

## Alternatives Considered

Any other approaches you thought about.

## Compatibility Notes

- Does this require any new dependencies beyond bash, python3, tmux, git?
- Does this work on both macOS and Linux?
- Does this work with bash 3.2+ (macOS default)?
