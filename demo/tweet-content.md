## Thread

### Reply 1 — The Hook System

> How it works:
>
> Claude Code has a hooks system — shell commands that fire on tool events.
>
> vibe-command maps 12 different events to Red Alert 2 sound clips:
> - Git push → "Moving out"
> - Tests pass → "Affirmative"
> - npm install → "Reinforcements have arrived"
> - Error → "Unable to comply"
>
> It's dumb. It's perfect.

### Reply 2 — The HUD

> The tmux status bar shows:
>
> - Work time today (gap-aware, not wall clock)
> - Output tokens consumed
> - Active subagents
> - Today's commits
> - Git branch + status
>
> All cached with TTLs so it doesn't slow anything down.
>
> It's basically a dev ops dashboard in your terminal.

### Reply 3 — Flag Themes

> The installer auto-detects your country and themes the HUD in your flag colors.
>
> 50+ countries supported. Israel gets blue/white. US gets red/navy. Ukraine gets blue/gold.
>
> Switch anytime:
> bash ~/.vibe-command/scripts/flag-theme.sh JP --generate
>
> Your terminal, your colors.

### Reply 4 — The Vibe

> This is what vibe coding actually looks like.
>
> Not "let AI write spaghetti."
> Not "prompt and pray."
>
> It's: I have a command center. Claude is my army.
> Every tool call has audio feedback.
> Every session feels like a mission briefing.

## Alt Hooks (A/B test)

**Hook A (nostalgia):**
> POV: You grew up on Red Alert 2 and now your AI coding agent says "Yes, Commander" every time it commits.

**Hook B (technical):**
> I built a tmux HUD + sound system for Claude Code that makes every coding session feel like you're commanding an army. Open source, one-command install.

**Hook C (controversial):**
> "Vibe coding" but make it actually good. Red Alert 2 sounds + tmux HUD + auto flag theme. Your terminal has never looked or sounded this cool.
